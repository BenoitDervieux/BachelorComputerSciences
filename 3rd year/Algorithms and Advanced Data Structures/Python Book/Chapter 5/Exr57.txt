To me, the first algorthm I am thinkin about is an algorithm that would add A[0] with A[1] to A[n - 1] and store the total in a hash list or another array.
The other storing array could be empty and resize if the total is smaller and it would store every value att it's space otehrwise none.
This has flaws but I don't really know other solution here.

Well that was easier than that:
We create an array of false first with the length of A.
We iterate through the array,if the value is new, we put it True at the index of this array.
If this is not new and it's already True, we return the value.
