Let's use the same example than the book is using, from 7 to 15 places.
Let's calculate how much it would need: 
16 places times 3 cyber dollars, so 48 cyber dollars that should be accumulated between the 4th place and the 7th place.
This equals to 12 cyber dollar for each place.
Which would be 6 times more costly than the first implementation.
