To swap 2 nodes in a linked list, what is possible to do is to
1 - take a previous node before the two to swap
2 - Access node1 and node2 to swap
3 - Acces nextNode
4 - Place prev.next = node2, node2.next = node1 and node1.next = nextNode

To swap 2 nodes in a doubly linked list, it is possible to:
1 - take a previous node before the two to swap
2 - Access node1 and node2 to swap
3 - Acces nextNode
4 - Place prev.next = node2 and node2.prev = prev, 
5- node2.next = node1 and node1.prev=node2 
6 - node1.next = nextNode and nextNode.prev = node1

The second methods takes more step which are still O(1) so it's sensibly the same time
