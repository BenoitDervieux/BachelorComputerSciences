Solution
Proof
Part 1: Lower Bound

Base Case: For a tree with 1 node (height 0), log(2)-1 = 0 holds.
Inductive Step: Assume the inequality holds for all trees with fewer than n nodes.
A proper binary tree with n nodes has at least 2^h nodes (in the worst case, a complete binary tree).
So, n ≥ 2^h.
Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get log(n) ≥ h.
Therefore, log(n+1)-1 ≤ log(n) ≤ h.
Part 2: Upper Bound

Base Case: For a tree with 1 node (height 0), (1-1)/2 = 0 holds.
Inductive Step: Assume the inequality holds for all trees with fewer than n nodes.
A proper binary tree with n nodes has at most 2^(h+1)-1 nodes (in the worst case, a complete binary tree with height h+1).
So, n ≤ 2^(h+1)-1.
Rearranging, we get 2^(h+1) ≥ n+1.
Taking the logarithm of both sides, we get h+1 ≥ log(n+1).
Therefore, h ≤ log(n+1)-1.
