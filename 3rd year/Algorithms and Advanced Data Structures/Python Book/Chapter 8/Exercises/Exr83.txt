Proposition 8.4: The height of a nonempty tree T is equal to the maximum of the depths of its leaf positions.

Basically, we define the height by measuring the depth of the furthest leave from the root. So this proposition makes sense because
1 : it has to be a leaf and 2 : we should take the downer leaf.
