It is not efficient to make repetitive calls because the upper bond can be pretty slow.

Adding an element can have a O(n). Here, adding n new elements would then have a time complexity of n * O(n) which is O(n**2)

This is why this isn't the best implementation.

A better implementation would be to:
1. Create a new array of size > initial array + array to implement
2. Add the first part of the array before the i index
3. Add the element we wanted to add
4. add the last part of the initial array
5. Replace the array inside the class by the new array
