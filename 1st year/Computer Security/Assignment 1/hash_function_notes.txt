Hashing notes
All the other algorithm were about comparing and get the answer yes or true

Division method is about using modulus
A lot of collisions but good performance

Non-deterministic hash function = use random one

Universal hash function satisfies universal hash properties
hash(k) = (((ak + b) mod p) mod m)

takes a and b inferior to the size of the input. k is a constant. P is a big prime. m is the size i want

Property of universality => the probability to have collision is <= 1/m for all any 2 different 2 keys ion my universe.
It's a measure of how well distributed things are.
The length is expected to be constant.

Indicator random variable = variable 

Xij over choice of h function in the hash fanily. Xij = 1 if h(ki) = h(kj), 0 otherwise.
Size of chain at h(ki) = Xi = sum over j= 0 to u-1 of Xij

Expected value h appartient à H, {Xi} = Expected sum j of Xij
